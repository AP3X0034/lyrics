guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do... so i drive home alone, as i turn off the light i'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do... he's the time taken up, but there's never enough and he's all that i need to fall into drew looks at me i fake a smile so he won't see i don't know what i want, so don't ask me cause i'm still trying to figure it out don't know what's down this road, i'm just walking trying to see through the rain coming down even though i'm not the only one who feels the way i do i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh but life goes on oh, i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world got the radio on, my old blue jeans and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve

girl you have a way of coming easily to me and when you take, you take the very best of me so i start a fight cause i need to feel something and you do what you want cause i'm not what you wanted oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray and i stood there loving you and wished them all away and you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried, cried for you and i know you wouldn't have told nobody if i died, died for you (died for you) oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you i didn't know what i would find when i went looking for a reason, i know i didn't read between the lines and, baby, i've got nowhere to go i tried to take the road less traveled by but nothing seems to work the first few times am i right? so how can i ever try to be better? nobody ever lets me in i can still see you, this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside you saw me there, but never knew i would give it all up to be a part of this, a part of you and now it's all too late so you see you could've helped if you had wanted to but no one notices until it's too late to do anything so how can i ever try to be better? nobody ever lets me in i can still see you, this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside so how can i ever try to be better? nobody ever lets me in i can still see you, this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty is the face in the mirror looking back at you you walk around here thinking you're not pretty but that's not true, 'cause i know you hold on baby you're losing it the water's high you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone i guess it's true that love was all you wanted 'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change hoping it will end up in his pocket but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay not his price to pay hold on baby you're losing it the water's high you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone hold on baby you're losing it the water's high you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone oh goodbye, baby with a smile, baby, baby cory's eyes are like a jungle he smiles, it's like the radio he whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows these pretty girls on every corner they watch him as he's walking home saying, \"does he know?\" will you ever know? you're beautiful every little piece love and don't you know you're really gonna be someone ask anyone and when you find everything you looked for i hope your life will lead you back to my door oh, but if it don't stay beautiful cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day i'm taking pictures in my mind so i can save them for a rainy day it's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away i should say, hey, by the way you're beautiful every little piece love and don't you know you're really gonna be someone ask anyone and when you find everything you looked for i hope your life will lead you back to my door oh, but if it don't stay beautiful if you and i are a story that never gets told if what you are is a daydream i'll never get to hold at least you'll know you're beautiful every little piece love and don't you know you're

can see that i've been crying baby you know all the right things to say but do you honestly expect me to believe we could ever be the same? you say that the past is the past, you need one chance it

and ran when you tried just two kids, you and i oh my my my my well, i was sixteen when suddenly i wasn't that little girl you used to see but your eyes still shined like pretty lights and our daddies

eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine i'll still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky, oh my my my i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel the other on my heart i look around, turn the radio down he says, \"baby is something wrong?\" i say, \"nothing, i was just thinking how we don't have a song\" and he says our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late, tapping on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date: \"man, i didn't kiss her, and i should have\" and when i got home 'fore i said amen asking god if he could play it again i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day had gone all wrong and been trampled on and lost and thrown away got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed i almost didn't notice all the roses and the note that said our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late, tapping on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date: \"man, i didn't kiss her, and i should have\" and when i got home 'fore i said amen asking god if he could play it again i've heard every album, listened to the radio waited for something to come along that was as good as our song 'cause our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late, tapping on his window when we're on the phone and he talks real slow 'cause it's late and his mama don't know our song is the way he laughs the first date: \"man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have\" and when i got home 'fore i said amen asking god if he could play it again play it again i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car i grabbed a pen and an old napkin and i wrote down our song friday night beneath the stars in a field behind your yard you and i are

your friends you ain't seen in a while try and stay out of everybody's way it's your freshman year and you're going to be here for the next four years in this town hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say \"you know, i haven't seen you around before\" because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're going to believe them and when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out well, count to ten, take it in this is life before you know who you're going to be fifteen you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail and soon enough you're best friends laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool we'll be outta here as soon as we can and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car and you're feeling like flying and your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one and you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends when the night ends because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're going to believe them when you're fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin 'round but in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team but i didn't know it at fifteen when all you wanted was to be wanted wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now back then i swore i was going to marry him someday but i realized some bigger dreams of mine and abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind and we both cried because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're going to believe them and when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall i've found time can heal most anything and you just might find who you're supposed to be i didn't know who i was supposed to be at fifteen la la la la la la la la

you put your arm around me for the first time you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine flash forward, and we're taking on the world together and there's a drawer of my things at your place you learn my secrets and figure out why i'm guarded you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes but we got bills to pay we got nothing figured out when it was hard to take yes, yes this is what i thought about: do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?

(hold on) we're gonna make it now (hold on) and i can see it yeah, yeah i can see it now (see it now) the way you move is like a full on rainstorm and i'm a house of cards you're the kind of reckless that should send me running but i kinda know that i won't get far and you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch close enough to hope you couldn't see what i was thinking of drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile my mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea you touch me once and it's really something you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be i'm on my guard for the rest of the world but with you i know it's no good and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile i run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right and lead me up the staircase won't you whisper soft and slow? i'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile and the sparks fly oh, baby, smile and the sparks fly i'm so glad you made time to see me how's life, tell me, how's your family i haven't seen them in a while you've been good, busier than ever we small talk, work and the weather your guard is up and i know why 'cause the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind you gave me roses and i left them there to die so this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you, saying i'm sorry for that night and i'd go back to december all the time it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine i'd go back to december, turn around and make it alright i go back to december all the time these days i haven't been sleeping staying up playing back myself leaving when your birthday passed and i didn't call and i think about summer, all the beautiful times i watched you laughing from the passenger side and realized i loved you in the fall and then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye so this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you, saying i'm sorry for that night and i'd go back to december all the time it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own mind i go back to december all the time i miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right and how you held me in your arms that september night the first time you ever saw me cry maybe this is wishful thinking probably mindless dreaming but if we loved again i swear i'd love you right i'd go back in time and change it, but i can't so if the chain is on your door, i understand but this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night and i'd go back to december... it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine i'd go back to december, turn around and make it alright i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own mind i go back to december all the time all the time i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl i sneak in and see your friends and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel and she is yelling at a bridesmaid somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry this is surely not what you thought it would be i lose myself in a daydream where i stand and say don't say yes, run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said \"speak now\" fond gestures are exchanged and the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march and i am hiding in the curtains it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen but i know you wish it was me you wish it was me (don't you) don't say yes, run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said \"speak now\" don't say yes, run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said \"speak now\" ooh, la-da-da-da, oh ooh, ooh (say a single vow) i hear the preacher say \"speak now or forever hold your peace\" there's the silence, there's my last chance i stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me horrified looks from everyone in the room but i'm only looking at you i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl (hehe!) don't say yes, run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said \"speak now\" and you say \"let's run away now i'll meet you when i'm out of my tux at the back door\" baby, i didn't say my vows so glad you were around when they said \"speak now\" long were the nights when my days once revolved around you counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through... again my mother accused me of losing my mind but i swore i was fine you paint me a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain and i lived in your chess game but you changed the rules everyday wonderin' which version of you i might get on the phone, tonight well i stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why dear john, i see it all now that you're gone don't you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home i shoulda' known well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love and take it away and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand and i look back in regret how i ignored when they said \"run as fast as you can\" dear john, i see it all now that you're gone don't you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home dear john, i see it all now it was wrong don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by your dark, twisted games when i loved you so? i shoulda' known you are an expert at sorry and keeping the lines blurry never impressed by me acing your tests all the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes 'cause you burned them out but i took your matches before fire could catch me so don't look now i'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town, yeah oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh dear john, i see it all now that you're gone don't you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home i see it all now that you're gone don't you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress wrote you a song, you shoulda' known you shoulda' known don't you think i was too young you shoulda' known you, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me you have knocked me off my feet again got me feeling like i'm nothing you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard calling me out when i'm wounded you, picking on the weaker man but you can take me down with just one single blow but you don't know what you don't know someday, i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean? you, with your switching sides and your wildfire lies and your humiliation you have pointed out my flaws again as if i don't already see them i walk with my head down, trying to block you out 'cause i'll never impress you i just want to feel okay again i bet you got pushed around somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now 'cause you can't lead me down that road and you don't know what you don't know someday, i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean? and i can see you years from now in a bar talking over a football game with that same big loud opinion but nobody's listening washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing but all you are is mean all you are is mean and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean but someday i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever going to be is mean, yeah! someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever going to be is mean why you gotta be so mean? someday, i'll be living in a big old city (why you gotta be so mean?) and all you're ever gonna be is mean (why you gotta be so mean?) someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me (why you gotta be so mean?) and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean? i used to think one day we'd tell the story of us how we met and the sparks flew instantly and people would say they're the lucky ones i used to know my place was a spot next to you now i'm searching the room for an empty seat 'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on oh, a simple complication miscommunications lead to fallout so many things that i wish you knew so many walls up that i can't break through now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me? yeah, i don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter how'd we end up this way? see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy and you're doing your best to avoid me i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us of how i was losing my mind when i saw you here but you held your pride like you should have held me oh, i'm scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing? i'd tell you i miss you, but i don't know how i've never heard silence quite this loud now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me? yeah, and i don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now this is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less but i liked it better when you were on my side the battle's in your hands now but i would lay my armor down if you say you'd rather love than fight so many things that you wish i knew but the story of us might be ending soon now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me? yeah, and i don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me? yeah and i don't know what to say since a twist of fate, because we're going down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now the end your little hand's wrapped around my finger and it's so quiet in the world tonight your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming so i

vacancy vanished when i saw your face all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you your eyes whispered \"have we met?\" across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me the playful conversation starts counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy and it was enchanting to meet you all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you this night is sparkling don't you let it go i'm wonderstruck blushing all the way home i'll spend forever wondering if you knew i was enchanted to meet you the lingering question kept me up 2am, who do you love? i wonder 'til i'm wide awake

the look on your face lit through the darkness at 1:58 the words that you whispered for just us to know you told me you loved me so why did you go away? away i do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane that july 9th the beat of your heart it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms but now i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name, forever the name on my lips i do remember the swing of your step the life of the party, you're showing off again and i roll my eyes and then you pull me in i'm not much for dancing but for you i did because i love your handshake, meeting my father i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions but now i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name, forever the name on my lips so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are hope it's nice where you are and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed you can plan for a change in weather and time but i never planned on you changing your mind so i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name, forever the name on my lips just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips forever the name on my lips just like our last i said remember this moment, in the back of my mind the time we stood with our shaking hands the crowds in the stands went wild we were the kings and the queens and they read off our names the night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same you held your head like a hero on a history book page it was the end of a decade but the start of an age long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders one day, we will be remembered i said remember this feeling i passed the pictures around of all the years that we stood there on the side-lines wishing for right now we are the kings and the queens you traded your baseball cap for a crown when they gave us our trophies and we held them up for our town and the cynics were outraged screaming \"this is absurd\" cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders i'm not afraid long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you i was screaming long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day, we will be remembered hold on to spinning around confetti falls to the ground may these memories break our fall will you take a moment? promise me this that you'll stand by me forever but if god forbid fate should step in and force us into a goodbye if you have children some day when they point to the pictures please tell them my name tell them how the crowds went wild tell them how i hope they shine long live the walls we crashed through i had the time of my life, with you long, long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders i'm not afraid singing, long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you and long, long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day, we will be remembered elevator buttons and morning air strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares but right now my time is theirs seems like there's always someone who disapproves they'll judge it like they know about me and you and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do the jury's out, but my choice is you so don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high, the water's rough but this love is ours you never know what people have up their sleeves ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles but i don't care 'cause right now you're mine and you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high, the water's rough but this love is ours and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you 'cause i love the gap between your teeth and i love the riddles that you speak and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored 'cause my heart is yours so don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine but they can't take what's ours they can't take what's ours the stakes are high, the water's rough but this love is ours last night i heard my own heart beating sounded like footsteps on my stairs six months gone and i'm still reaching even though i know you're not there i was playing back a thousand memories, baby thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through maybe i've been going back too much lately when time stood still and i had you come back, come back, come back to me like you would, you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back, come back, come back to me like you could, you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now i know people change and these things happen but i remember how it was back then wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing cause nothing like this ever happened to them now i'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street flashback to the night when you said to me \"nothing's gonna change, not for me and you\" not before i knew how much i had to lose come back, come back, come back to me like you would, you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back, come back, come back to me like you could, you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now if you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on i've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone i just want it back the way it was before and i just want to see you back at my front door and i say \"come back, come back, come back to me like you would before you said it's not that easy before the fight, before i locked you out\" but i take it all back now come back, come back, come back to me like you would, you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back, come back, come back to me like you could, you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now you'd be here by now it's not the kind of ending you want to see now baby, what about the ending? oh, i thought you'd be here by now thought you'd be here by now tall, dark, and superman he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away to save the world or go to work it's the same thing to me he's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him i hang on every word you say, yay and you smile and say, how are you? i say, \"just fine\" i always forget to tell you, i love you, i love you forever i watch superman fly away you've got a busy day today go save the world, i'll be around i watch superman fly away come back i'll be with you someday i'll be right here on the ground when you come back down tall, dark and beautiful he's complicated, he's irrational but i hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin' he's not all bad like his reputation and i can't hear one single word they say and you'll leave, got places to be and i'll be ok i always forget to tell you i love you, i loved you from the very first day i watch superman fly away you've got a busy day today go save the world, i'll be around i watch superman fly away come back i'll be with you someday i'll be right here on the ground when you come back down and i watch you fly around the world and i hope you don't save some other girl don't forget, don't forget about me i'm far away but i never let you go i'm love-struck and looking out the window don't forget, don't forget where i'll be right here wishing the flowers were from you wishing the card was from you wishing the call was from you 'cause i loved you from the very first day i watch superman fly away you've got a busy day today go save the world, i'll be around forever and ever here i watch superman fly away i swear i'll be with you someday i'll be right here on the ground when you come back down la, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la when you come back down i'm walking fast through the traffic lights busy streets and busy lives and all we know is touch and go we are alone with our changing minds we fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time and i never saw you coming and i'll never be the same you come around and the armor falls pierce the room like a cannon ball now all we know, is don't let go we are alone just you and me up in your room and our slates are clean just twin fire signs, four blue eyes so you were never a saint and i've loved in shades of wrong we learn to live with the pain mosaic broken hearts but this love is brave and wild and i never saw you coming and i'll never be the same this is a state of grace this is the worthwhile fight love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right these are the hands of fate you're my achilles heel this is the golden age of something good and right and real and i never saw you coming and i'll never be the same and i never saw you coming and i'll never be the same this is a state of grace this is a worthwhile fight love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey, all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey, all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes tell myself it's time now, gotta let go but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head in burning red loving him was red losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey, all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head comes back to me, burning red yeah, yeah his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street put your lips close to mine as long as they don't touch out of focus, eye to eye till the gravity's too much and i'll do anything you say if you say it with your hands and i'd be smart to walk away but you're quick sand this slope is treacherous this path is reckless this slope is treacherous and i i i like it i can't decide if it's a choice getting swept away i hear the sound of my own voice asking you to stay and all we are is skin and bone trained to get along forever going with the flow but you're friction this slope is treacherous this path is reckless this slope is treacherous and i i i like it two headlights shine through the sleepless night and i will get you get you alone your name has echoed through my mind and i just think you should think you should know that nothing safe is worth the drive and i will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home this hope is treacherous this daydream is dangerous this slope is treacherous and i-i-i, i-i-i, i-i-i two headlights shine through the sleepless night and i will get you get you alone your name has echoed through my mind and i just think you should think you should know that nothing safe is worth the drive and i will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home this hope is treacherous this daydream is dangerous this hope is treacherous i-i-i, i-i-i, i-i-i ... two headlights shine through the sleepless night and i will get you get you alone your name has echoed through my mind and i just think you should think you should know that nothing safe is worth the drive and i will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home i'll follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home this slope is treacherous and i-i-i like it once upon a time, a few mistakes ago i was in your sights, you got me alone you found me, you found me, you found me i guess you didn't care, and i guess i liked that and when i fell hard, you took a step back without me, without me, without me and he's long gone, when he's next to me and i realize the blame is on me 'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been till you put me down, oh i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been now i'm lying on the cold hard ground oh, oh trouble, trouble, trouble oh, oh trouble, trouble, trouble no apologies, he'll never see you cry pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why you're drowning, you're drowning you're drowning and i heard you moved on, from whispers on the street a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be and now i see, now i see now i see he was long gone when he met me and i realize the joke is on me, hey! i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been till you put me down, oh i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been now i'm lying on the cold hard ground oh, oh trouble, trouble, trouble oh, oh trouble, trouble, trouble and the saddest fear, comes creeping in that you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah! i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been till you put me down, oh i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been now i'm lying on the cold hard ground oh, oh trouble, trouble, trouble oh, oh trouble, trouble, trouble i walked through the door with you, the air was cold but something 'bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister's house and you've still got it in your drawer, even now oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze we're singing in a car getting lost upstate the autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all 'cause there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me wind in my hair, i was there, i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team you taught me about your past thinking your future was me and i know it's long gone, and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to 'cause there we are again in the middle of the night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs, i was there, i remember it all too well, yeah and maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'till you tore it all up running scared, i was there, i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 'cause i remember it all, all, all... too well time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah because there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too well wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too well it feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh it feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight to fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh yeah we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time it's miserable and magical, oh yeah tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines it's time, uh uh i don't know about you, but i'm feeling 22 everything will be alright if you keep me next to you you don't know about me, but i bet you wanted to everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 22 it seems like one of those nights this place is too crowded, too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's taylor swift, anyway? ew) it seems like one of those nights we ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping yeah we're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way it's miserable and magical, oh yeah tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time oh oh i don't know about you, but i'm feeling 22 everything will be alright if you keep me next to you you don't know about me, but i bet you wanted to everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 22 i don't know about you 22, 22 it feels like one of those nights we ditch the whole scene it feels like one of those nights we won't be sleeping it feels like one of those nights you look like bad news, i gotta have you i gotta have you i don't know about you, but i'm feeling 22 everything will be alright if you keep me next to you you don't know about me, but i bet you wanted to everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 22 dancing like 22, yeah, 22, yeah yeah it feels like one of those nights we ditch the whole scene it feels like one of those nights we won't be sleeping it feels like one of those nights you look like bad news, i gotta have you i gotta have you i bet this time of night you're still up i bet you're tired from a long hard week i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city and i bet sometimes you wonder about me and i just want to tell you it takes everything in me not to call you and i wish i could run to you and i hope you know that everytime i don't i almost do, i almost do i bet you think i either moved on or hate you ‘cause each time you reach out there's no reply i bet it never, ever occurred to you that i can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye and i just want to tell you it takes everything in me not to call you and i wish i could run to you and i hope you know that everytime i don't i almost do, i almost do oh, we made quite a mess, babe it's probably better off this way and i confess, baby in my dreams you're touching my face and asking me if i'd want to try again with you and i almost do and i just want to tell you it takes everything in me not to call you and i wish i could run to you and i hope you know that everytime i don't i almost do, i almost do i bet this time of night you're still up i bet you're tired from a long hard week i bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window looking out at the city and i hope sometimes you wonder about me i remember when we broke up, the first time saying, \"this is it, i've had enough\" 'cause, like we hadn't seen each other in a month when you said you needed space – what<u+203d> then you come around again and say \"baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change; trust me\" remember how that lasted for a day? i say, \"i hate you,\" we break up, you call me, \"i love you\" ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh we called it off again last night but ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh this time, i'm telling you, i'm telling you we are never, ever, ever getting back together we are never, ever, ever getting back together you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together like, ever i'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me falling for it screaming that i'm right and you would hide away and find your peace of mind with some indie record that's much cooler than mine ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh we called it off again last night but ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh this time, i'm telling you, i'm telling you we are never, ever, ever getting back together we are never, ever, ever getting back together you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh (yeah!) ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh (yeah!) ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh (yeah!) oh—oh—oh! i used to think that we were forever, ever and i used to say, \"never say never\" huh, so he calls me up and he's like, \"i still love you\" and i'm like, \"i just— i mean, this is exhausting, you know? like, we are never getting back together, like, ever\" we are never, ever, ever getting back together we are never, ever, ever getting back together you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together we— (ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh, ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh) —getting back together we—

pretty sure we almost broke up last night i threw my phone across the room, at you i was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stay this morning i said we should talk about it 'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved that's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said okay let's talk and i said stay, stay, stay i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad but i think that it's best if we both stay before you i'd only dated self-indulgent takers who took all of their problems out on me but you carry my groceries and now i'm always laughing and i love you because you have given me no choice but to stay, stay, stay i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time you think that it's funny when i'm

times that you didn't leave it's been occurring to me i'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life stay, and i'll be loving you for quite some time no one else is gonna love me when i get mad,

new york time back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme took off faster than a green light, go hey, you skip the conversation when you already know i left a note on the door with a joke we'd made and that was the first day and darling, it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground spinning like a girl in a brand new dress we had this big wide city all to ourselves we blocked the noise with the sound of 'i need you' and for the first time i had something to lose and i guess we fell apart in the usual way and the story's got dust on every page but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now and i see your face in every crowd 'cause darling, it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground tonight i'm gonna dance for all that we've been through but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you tonight i'm gonna dance like you were in this room but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground tonight i'm gonna dance for all that we've been through but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you tonight i'm gonna dance like you were in this room but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you long handwritten note, deep in your pocket words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late i stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait we had a beautiful magic love there what a sad beautiful tragic love affair in dreams, i meet you in warm conversation we both wake in lonely beds, different cities and time is taking its sweet time erasing you and you've got your demons and darling they all look like me we had a beautiful magic love there what a sad beautiful tragic love affair distance, timing, breakdown, fighting silence, the train runs off its tracks kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen? hang up, give up, and

summer of '45 picked me up, late one night at the window we were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in the night we snuck into a yacht club party pretending to be a duchess and a prince and i said, \"oh my, what a marvelous tune\" it was the best night, never would forget how we moved the whole place was dressed to the nines and we were dancing, dancing like we're made of starlight, starlight like we're made of starlight, starlight he said, \"look at you worrying too much about things you can't change you'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way\" he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me \"don't you see the starlight, starlight? don't you dream impossible things?\" like, \"oh my, what a marvelous tune\" it was the best night, never would forget how we moved the whole place was dressed to the nines and we were dancing, dancing like we're made of starlight, starlight like we're made of starlight, starlight ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy ooh, ooh, dancing with me ooh, ooh, we could get married have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream oh my, what a marvelous tune it was the best

made of starlight, starlight like we dream impossible dreams like starlight, starlight like we dream impossible dreams don't you see the starlight, starlight? don't you dream impossible things? took a deep breath in the mirror he didn't like it when i wore high heels but i do turn the lock and put my headphones on he always said he didn't get this song but i do, i do walked in expecting you'd be late but you got here early and you stand and wave i walk to you you pull my chair out and help me in and you don't know how nice that is but i do and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a cafe, i watched it begin again you said you never met one girl who had as many james taylor records as you but i do we tell stories and you don't know why i'm coming off a little shy but i do and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a cafe, i watched it begin again and we walked down the block, to my car and i almost brought him up but you start to talk about the movies that your family watches every single christmas and i want to talk about that and for the first time what's past is past 'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a cafe, i watched it begin again but on a wednesday in a cafe, i watched it begin again you should've been there should've burst through the door with that 'baby i'm right here' smile and it would've felt like a million little shining stars had just aligned and i would've been so happy christmas lights glisten i've got my eye on the door just waiting for you to walk in but the time is ticking people ask me how i've been as i comb back through my memory how you said you'd be here you said you'd be here and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all laughing as i'm looking around the room but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew and the hours pass by now i just wanna be alone but your close friends always seem to know when there's something really wrong so they follow me down the hall and there in the bathroom i try not to fall apart and the sinking feeling starts as i say hopelessly \"he said he'd be here\" and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all laughing and asking me about you but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew what do you say when tears are streaming down your face in front of everyone you know? and what do you do when the one who means the most to you is the one who didn't show? you should've been here and i would've been so happy and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all standing around me singing \"happy birthday to you\" but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh i knew oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh you call me later and said, \"i'm sorry i didn't make it\" and i said, \"i'm sorry too\" and that was the moment i knew you said it in a simple way 4 am, the second day how strange that i don't know you at all stumbled through the long goodbye one last kiss, then catch your flight right when i was just about to fall i told myself don't get attached but in my mind i play it back spinning faster than the plane that took you and this is when the feeling sinks in i don't wanna miss you like this come back be here, come back be here i guess you're in new york today i don't wanna need you this way come back be here, come back be here the delicate beginning rush the feeling you can know so much without knowing anything at all and now that i can put this down if i had known what i'd known now i never would have played so nonchalant taxi cabs and busy streets that never bring you back to me i can't help but wish you took me with you and this is when the feeling sinks in i don't wanna miss you like this come back be here, come back be here i guess you're in london today i don't wanna need you this way come back be here, come back be here this is falling in love in the cruelest way this is falling for you and you are worlds away new york be here but you're in london and i break down cause it's not fair that you're not around i don't wanna miss you like this come back be here come back be here don't look at me, you got a girl at home and everybody knows that, everybody knows that don't look at me, you got a girl at home and everybody knows that, everybody knows that i don't even know her but i feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right it's kinda like a code, yeah and you've been getting closer and closer and crossing so many lines and it would be a fine proposition if i was a stupid girl but honey i am no one's exception this i have previously learned so don't look at me, you got a girl at home and everybody knows that, everybody knows that don't look at me, you got a girl at home and everybody knows that, everybody knows that i see you turn off your phone now you've got me alone, and i say don't look at me, you got a girl at home and everybody knows that, everybody knows that i just want to make sure you understand perfectly you're the kind of man who makes me sad while she waits up, you chase down the newest thing and take for granted what you have and it would be a fine proposition if i was a stupid girl and yeah, i might go with it if i hadn't once been just like her so don't look at me, you got a girl at home and everybody knows that, everybody knows that don't look at me, you got a girl at home and everybody knows that, everybody
