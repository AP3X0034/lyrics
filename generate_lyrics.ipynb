      "He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word\n",
      "From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,\n",
      "And found it in thy cheek: he can afford\n",
      "No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live. \n",
      "Then thank him not for that which he doth say,\n",

      "The owner's tongue doth publish every where.\n",
      "Our love was new, and then but in the spring,\n",
      "When I was wont to greet it with my lays;\n",
      "As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,\n",
      "And stops his pipe in growth of riper days:\n",
      "Not that the summer is less pleasant now\n",
      "Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\n",

      "That having such a scope to show her pride,\n",
      "The argument all bare is of more worth\n",
      "Than when it hath my added praise beside!\n",
      "O! blame me not, if I no more can write!\n",
      "Look in your glass, and there appears a face\n",
      "That over-goes my blunt invention quite, \n",
      "Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.\n",
      "Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,\n",
      "To mar the subject that before was well?\n",
      "For to no other pass my verses tend\n",
      "Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;\n",
      "And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,\n",
      "Your own glass shows you when you look in it.\n",
      "To me, fair friend, you never can be old,\n",

      "Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,\n",
      "In process of the seasons have I seen,\n",
      "Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,\n",
      "Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.\n",
      "Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,\n",
      "Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;\n",
      "So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,\n",
      "Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:\n",
      "For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:\n",
      "Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.\n",
      "Let not my love be called idolatry,\n",
      "Nor my beloved as an idol show,\n",
      "Since all alike my songs and praises be\n",
      "To one, of one, still such, and ever so.\n",
      "Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\n",
      "Still constant in a wondrous excellence;\n",
      "Therefore my verse to constancy confined,\n",
      "One thing expressing, leaves out difference.\n",
      "Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,\n",
      "Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words;\n",
      "And in this change is my invention spent,\n",
      "Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\n",
      "Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone,\n",
      "Which three till now, never kept seat in one.\n",
      "When in the chronicle of wasted time\n",
      "I see descriptions of the fairest wights,\n",
      "And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,\n",
      "In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,\n",
      "Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,\n",
      "Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\n",
      "I see their antique pen would have expressed\n",
      "Even such a beauty as you master now.\n",
      "So all their praises are but prophecies\n",
      "Of this our time, all you prefiguring;\n",
      "And for they looked but with divining eyes,\n",
      "They had not skill enough your worth to sing:\n",
      "For we, which now behold these present days,\n",
      "Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\n",
      "Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul\n",
      "Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,\n",
      "Can yet the lease of my true love control, \n",
      "Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.\n",
      "The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,\n",
      "And the sad augurs mock their own presage;\n",
      "Incertainties now crown themselves assured,\n",
      "And peace proclaims olives of endless age.\n",
      "Now with the drops of this most balmy time,\n",
      "My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,\n",
      "Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,\n",
      "While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:\n",
      "And thou in this shalt find thy monument,\n",
      "When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.\n",
      "What's in the brain that ink may character\n",
      "Which hath not figured\r\n",
      "to thee my true spirit?\n",
      "What's new to speak, what now to register,\n",
      "That may express my love, or thy dear merit?\n",
      "Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,\n",
      "I must each day say o'er the very same;\n",
      "Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine, \n",
      "Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.\n",
      "So that eternal love in love's fresh case,\n",
      "Weighs not the dust and injury of age,\n",
      "Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\n",
      "But makes antiquity for aye his page;\n",
      "Finding the first conceit of love there bred,\n",
      "Where time and outward form would show it dead.\n",
      "O! never say that I was false of heart,\n",
      "Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,\n",
      "As easy might I from my self depart\n",
      "As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:\n",

      "For what care I who calls me well or ill, \n",
      "So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?\n",
      "You are my all-the-world, and I must strive\n",
      "To know my shames and praises from your tongue;\n",

      "me to go about\n",
      "Doth part his function and is partly blind,\n",

ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth, who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:   hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,   thine by thy beauty being false to me. that thou hast her it is not all my grief, and yet it may be said i loved her dearly; that she hath thee is of my wailing chief, a loss in love that touches me more nearly.  loving offenders thus i will excuse ye: thou dost love her, because thou know'st i love her; and for my sake even so doth she abuse me, suffering my friend for my sake to approve her. if i lose thee, my loss is my love's gain, and losing her, my friend hath found that loss; both find each other, and i lose both twain, and both for my sake lay on me this cross: but here's the joy; my friend and i are one; sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone. when most i wink, then do mine eyes best see, for all the day they view things unrespected; but when i sleep, in dreams they look on thee, and darkly bright, are bright in dark directed. then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright, how would thy shadow's form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light, when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!  how would, i say, mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day, when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay! all days are nights to see till i see thee, and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me. if the dull substance of my flesh were thought, injurious distance should not stop my way; for then despite of space i would be brought,  from limits far remote, where thou dost stay.  no matter then although my foot did stand  upon the farthest earth removed from thee;  for nimble thought can jump both sea and land  as soon as think the place where he would be.  but ah! thought kills me that i am not thought,  to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,  but that, so much of earth and water wrought, i must attend time's leisure with my moan,  receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears, badges of either's woe. the other two, slight air and purging fire,  are both with thee, wherever i abide;  the first my thought, the other my desire,  these present-absent with swift motion slide.  for when these quicker elements are gone  in tender embassy of love to thee,  my life, being made of four, with two alone  sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy;  until life's composition be recured  by those swift messengers return'd from thee,  who even but now come back again, assured  of thy fair health, recounting it to me:  this told, i joy; but then no longer glad,  i send them back again and straight grow sad. mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, how to divide the conquest of thy sight; mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar, my heart mine eye the freedom of that right. my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, a closet never pierced with crystal eyes, but the defendant doth that plea deny, and says in him thy fair appearance lies. to 'cide this title is impannelled a quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart; and by their verdict is determined the clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:   as thus: mine eye's due is thine outward part,   and my heart's right, thine inward love of heart. betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took, and each doth good turns now unto the other: when that mine eye is famish'd for a look, or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother, with my love's picture then my eye doth feast, and to the painted banquet bids my heart; another time mine eye is my heart's guest, and in his thoughts of love doth share a part: so, either by thy picture or my love, thy self away, art present still with me; for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, and i am still with them, and they with thee; or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight awakes my heart, to heart's and eyes' delight. how careful was i when\r",

      " all mine eye and all my soul, and all my every part; and for this sin there is no remedy, it is so grounded inward in my heart. methinks no face so gracious is as mine, no shape so true, no truth of such account; and for myself mine own worth do define, as i all other in all worths surmount. but when my glass shows me myself indeed beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity, mine own self-love quite contrary i read; self so self-loving were iniquity. 'tis thee, myself, that for myself i praise, painting my age with beauty of thy days. against my love shall be as i am now, with time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn; when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn hath travelled on to age's steepy night; and all those beauties whereof now he's king are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, stealing away the treasure of his spring;  for such a time do i now fortify against confounding age's cruel knife, that he shall never cut from memory my sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life: his beauty shall in these black lines be seen, and they shall live, and he in them still green. when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced the rich proud cost of outworn buried age; when sometime lofty towers i see down-razed, and brass eternal slave to mortal rage; when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore, and the firm soil win of the watery main, increasing store with loss, and loss with store; when i have seen such interchange of state, or state itself confounded to decay; ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate  that time will come and take my love away.  this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose. since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, but sad mortality o'ersways their power, how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, whose action is no stronger than a flower? o! how shall summer's honey breath hold out, against the wrackful siege of battering days, when rocks impregnable are not so stout, nor gates of steel so strong but time decays? o fearful meditation! where, alack, shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid? or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back? or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? o! none, unless this miracle have might, that in black ink my love may still shine bright. tired with all these, for restful death i cry, as to behold desert a beggar born, and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity, and purest faith unhappily forsworn, and gilded honour shamefully misplaced, and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, and right perfection wrongfully disgraced, and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue-tied by authority, and folly, doctor-like, controlling skill, and simple truth miscalled simplicity, and captive good attending captain ill: tired with all these, from these would i be gone, save that, to die, i leave my love alone. ah! wherefore with infection should he live, and with his presence grace impiety, that sin by him advantage should achieve, and lace itself with his society?  why should false painting imitate his cheek, and steal dead seeming of his living hue? why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow, since his rose is true? why should he live, now nature bankrupt is, beggared of blood to blush through lively veins? for she hath no exchequer now but his, and proud of many, lives upon his gains. o! him she stores, to show what wealth she had in days long since, before these last so bad. thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, when beauty lived and died as flowers do now, before these bastard signs of fair were born, or durst inhabit on a living brow; before the golden tresses of the dead, the right of sepulchres, were shorn away, to live a second life on second head; ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay: in him those holy antique hours are seen, without all ornament, itself and true, making no summer of another's green, robbing no old to dress his beauty new; and him as for a map doth nature store, to show false art what beauty was of yore. those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend; all tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due, uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend. thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd; but those same tongues, that give thee so thine own, in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown. they look into the beauty of thy mind, and that in guess they measure by thy deeds; then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind, to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:  but why thy odour matcheth not thy show, the soil is this, that thou dost common grow. that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect, for slander's mark was ever yet the fair; the ornament of beauty is suspect, a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air. so thou be good, slander doth but approve thy worth the greater, being wooed of time; for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, and thou present'st a pure unstained prime. thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assailed, or victor being charged; yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise, to tie up envy, evermore enlarged, if some suspect of ill masked not thy show, then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe. no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell: nay, if you read this line, remember not the hand that writ it, for i love you so, that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, if thinking on me then should make you woe. o! if, i say, you look upon this verse, when i perhaps compounded am with clay, do not so much as my poor name rehearse; but let your love even with my life decay; lest the wise world should look into your moan, and mock you with me after i am gone. o! lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me, that you should love after my death,--dear love, forget me quite, for you in me can nothing worthy prove. unless you would devise some virtuous lie, to do more for me than mine own desert, and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart: o! lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue, my name be buried where my body is, and live no more to shame nor me nor you. for i am shamed by that which i bring forth, and so should you, to love things nothing worth. that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold, bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. in me thou see'st the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west; which by and by black night doth take away, death's second self, that seals up all in rest.  in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire, that on the ashes of his youth doth lie, as the death-bed, whereon it must expire, consumed with that which it was nourish'd by. this thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, to love that well, which thou must leave ere long. but be contented when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away, my life hath in this line some interest, which for memorial still with thee shall stay. when thou reviewest this, thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee: the earth can have but earth, which is his due; my spirit is thine, the better part of me: so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, the prey of worms, my body being dead; the coward conquest of a wretch's knife, too base of thee to be remembered. the worth of that is that which it contains, and that is this, and this with thee remains. so are you to my thoughts as food to life, or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground; and for the peace of you i hold such strife as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found. now proud as an enjoyer, and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure; now counting best to be with you alone, then better'd that the world may see my pleasure: sometime all full with feasting on your sight, and by and by clean starved for a look; possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had, or must from you be took. thus do i pine and surfeit day by day, or gluttoning on all, or all away. why is my verse so barren of new pride, so far from variation or quick change? why with the time do i not glance aside to new-found methods, and to compounds strange? why write i still all one, ever the same, and keep invention in a noted weed, that every word doth almost tell my name, showing their birth, and where they did proceed? o! know sweet love i always write of you, and you and love are still my argument; so all my best is dressing old words new, spending again what is already spent: for as the sun is daily new and old, so is my love still telling what is told. thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear, thy dial how thy precious minutes waste; the vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear, and of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.  the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory; thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know time's thievish progress to eternity. look what thy memory cannot contain, commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find those children nursed, delivered from thy brain, to take a new acquaintance of thy mind. these offices, so oft as thou wilt look, shall profit thee and much enrich thy book. so oft have i invoked thee for my muse, and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse. thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly, have added feathers to the learned's wing and given grace a double majesty. yet be most proud of that which i compile, whose influence is thine, and born of thee: in others' works thou dost but mend the style, and arts with thy sweet graces graced be; but thou art all my art, and dost advance as high as learning, my rude ignorance. whilst i alone did call upon thy aid, my verse alone had all thy gentle grace; but now my gracious numbers are decayed, and my sick muse doth give an other place. i grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen; yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of, and pays it thee again. he lends thee virtue, and he stole that word from thy behaviour; beauty doth he give, and found it in thy cheek: he can afford no praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.  then thank him not for that which he doth say, since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay. o! how i faint when i of you do write, knowing a better spirit doth use your name, and in the praise thereof spends all his might, to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame. but since your worth, wide as the ocean is, the humble as the proudest sail doth bear, my saucy bark, inferior far to his, on your broad main doth wilfully appear. your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride; or, being wracked, i am a worthless boat, he of tall building, and of goodly pride: then if he thrive and i be cast away, the worst was this, my love was my decay. or i shall live your epitaph to make, or you survive when i in earth am rotten, from hence your memory death cannot take, although in me each part will be forgotten. your name from hence immortal life shall have, though i, once gone, to all the world must die: the earth can yield me but a common grave, when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie. your monument shall be my gentle verse, which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read; and tongues to be your being shall rehearse, when all the breathers of this world are dead; you still shall live, such virtue hath my pen, where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men. i grant thou wert not married to my muse, and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject, blessing every book.  thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, finding thy worth a limit past my praise; and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days. and do so, love; yet when they have devised, what strained touches rhetoric can lend, thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized in true plain words, by thy true-telling friend; and their gross painting might be better used where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused. i never saw that you did painting need, and therefore to your fair no painting set; i found, or thought i found, you did exceed the barren tender of a poet's debt: and therefore have i slept in your report, that you yourself, being extant, well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short, speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.  this silence for my sin you did impute, which shall be most my glory being dumb; for i impair not beauty being mute, when others would give life, and bring a tomb. there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise. who is it that says most, which can say more, than this rich praise, that you alone, are you, in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew? lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory; but he that writes of you, if he can tell that you are you, so dignifies his story. let him but copy what in you is writ, not making worse what nature made so clear, and such a counterpart shall fame his wit, making his style admired every where. you to your beauteous blessings add a curse, being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse. my tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still, while comments of your praise richly compiled, reserve thy character with golden quill, and precious phrase by all the muses filed. i think good thoughts, whilst others write good words, and like unlettered clerk still cry 'amen' to every hymn that able spirit affords, in polished form of well-refined pen. hearing you praised, i say ''tis so, 'tis true,' and to the most of praise add something more; but that is in my thought, whose love to you, though words come hindmost, holds his rank before. then others, for the breath of words respect, me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect. was it the proud full sail of his great verse, bound for the prize of all too precious you, that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead? no, neither he, nor his compeers by night giving him aid, my verse astonished. he, nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence, as victors of my silence cannot boast; i was not sick of any fear from thence: but when your countenance filled up his line, then lacked i matter; that enfeebled mine. farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, and like enough thou know'st thy estimate, the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing; my bonds in thee are all determinate. for how do i hold thee but by thy granting? and for that riches where is my deserving? the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, and so my patent back again is swerving. thy self thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing, or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking; so thy great gift, upon misprision growing, comes home again, on better judgement making. thus have i had thee, as a dream doth flatter, in sleep a king, but waking no such matter. when thou shalt be disposed to set me light, and place my merit in the eye of scorn, upon thy side, against myself i'll fight, and prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn. with mine own weakness being best acquainted, upon thy part i can set down a story of faults concealed, wherein i am attainted; that thou in losing me shalt win much glory:  and i by this will be a gainer too; for bending all my loving thoughts on thee, the injuries that to myself i do, doing thee vantage, double-vantage me. such is my love, to thee i so belong, that for thy right, myself will bear all wrong. say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, and i will comment upon that offence: speak of my lameness, and i straight will halt, against thy reasons making no defence. thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill, to set a form upon desired change, as i'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will, i will acquaintance strangle, and look strange; be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, lest i, too much profane, should do it wrong, and haply of our old acquaintance tell.  for thee, against my self i'll vow debate, for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate. then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now; now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross, join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, and do not drop in for an after-loss: ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow, come in the rearward of a conquered woe; give not a windy night a rainy morrow, to linger out a purposed overthrow. if thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, when other petty griefs have done their spite, but in the onset come: so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortune's might; and other strains of woe, which now seem woe, compared with loss of thee, will not seem so. some glory in their birth, some in their skill, some in their wealth, some in their body's force, some in their garments though new-fangled ill; some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse; and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, wherein it finds a joy above the rest: but these particulars are not my measure, all these i better in one general best. thy love is better than high birth to me, richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost, of more delight than hawks and horses be; and having thee, of all men's pride i boast: wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take all this away, and me most wretched make. but do thy worst to steal thyself away, for term of life thou art assured mine; and life no longer than thy love will stay, for it depends upon that love of thine.  then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs, when in the least of them my life hath end. i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend: thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, since that my life on thy revolt doth lie. o what a happy title do i find, happy to have thy love, happy to die! but what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot? thou mayst be false, and yet i know it not. so shall i live, supposing thou art true, like a deceived husband; so love's face may still seem love to me, though altered new; thy looks with me, thy heart in other place: for there can live no hatred in thine eye, therefore in that i cannot know thy change. in many's looks, the false heart's history is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.  but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell; whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be, thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell. how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow, if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show! they that have power to hurt, and will do none, that do not do the thing they most do show, who, moving others, are themselves as stone, unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow; they rightly do inherit heaven's graces, and husband nature's riches from expense; they are the lords and owners of their faces, others, but stewards of their excellence. the summer's flower is to the summer sweet, though to itself, it only live and die, but if that flower with base infection meet, the basest weed outbraves his dignity:  for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds. how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which, like a canker in the fragrant rose, doth spot the beauty of thy budding name! o! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose. that tongue that tells the story of thy days, making lascivious comments on thy sport, cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise; naming thy name blesses an ill report. o! what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee, where beauty's veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see! take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege; the hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge. some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness; some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport; both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less: thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort. as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteem'd, so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated, and for true things deem'd. how many lambs might the stern wolf betray, if like a lamb he could his looks translate! how many gazers mightst thou lead away, if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state! but do not so, i love thee in such sort, as thou being mine, mine is thy good report. how like a winter hath my absence been from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen! what old december's bareness everywhere!  and yet this time removed was summer's time; the teeming autumn, big with rich increase, bearing the wanton burden of the prime, like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease: yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit; for summer and his pleasures wait on thee, and, thou away, the very birds are mute: or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer, that leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near. from you have i been absent in the spring, when proud pied april, dressed in all his trim, hath put a spirit of youth in every thing, that heavy saturn laughed and leapt with him. yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue, could make me any summer's story tell, or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:  nor did i wonder at the lily's white, nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose; they were but sweet, but figures of delight, drawn after you, you pattern of all those. yet seemed it winter still, and you away, as with your shadow i with these did play. the forward violet thus did i chide: sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, if not from my love's breath? the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd. the lily i condemned for thy hand, and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair; the roses fearfully on thorns did stand, one blushing shame, another white despair; a third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both, and to his robbery had annexed thy breath; but, for his theft, in pride of all his growth  a vengeful canker eat him up to death. more flowers i noted, yet i none could see,  but sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee. where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long, to speak of that which gives thee all thy might? spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song, darkening thy power to lend base subjects light? return forgetful muse, and straight redeem, in gentle numbers time so idly spent; sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument. rise, resty muse, my love's sweet face survey, if time have any wrinkle graven there; if any, be a satire to decay, and make time's spoils despised every where. give my love fame faster than time wastes life, so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife. o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed? both truth and beauty on my love depends; so dost thou too, and therein dignified. make answer muse: wilt thou not haply say, 'truth needs no colour, with his colour fixed; beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay; but best is best, if never intermixed'? because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb? excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be praised of ages yet to be. then do thy office, muse; i teach thee how to make him seem, long hence, as he shows now. my love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming; i love not less, though less the show appear; that love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming, the owner's tongue doth publish every where. our love was new, and then but in the spring, when i was wont to greet it with my lays; as philomel in summer's front doth sing, and stops his pipe in growth of riper days: not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, but that wild music burthens every bough, and sweets grown common lose their dear delight. therefore like her, i sometime hold my tongue: because i would not dull you with my song. alack! what poverty my muse brings forth, that having such a scope to show her pride, the argument all bare is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside! o! blame me not, if i no more can write! look in your glass, and there appears a face that over-goes my blunt invention quite,  dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace. were it not sinful then, striving to mend, to mar the subject that before was well? for to no other pass my verses tend than of your graces and your gifts to tell; and more, much more, than in my verse can sit, your own glass shows you when you look in it. to me, fair friend, you never can be old, for as you were when first your eye i ey'd, such seems your beauty still. three winters cold, have from the forests shook three summers' pride, three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned, in process of the seasons have i seen, three april perfumes in three hot junes burned, since first i saw you fresh, which yet are green. ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand, steal from his figure, and no pace perceived; so your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived: for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred: ere you were born was beauty's summer dead. let not my love be called idolatry, nor my beloved as an idol show, since all alike my songs and praises be to one, of one, still such, and ever so. kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind, still constant in a wondrous excellence; therefore my verse to constancy confined, one thing expressing, leaves out difference. fair, kind, and true, is all my argument, fair, kind, and true, varying to other words; and in this change is my invention spent, three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords. fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone, which three till now, never kept seat in one. when in the chronicle of wasted time i see descriptions of the fairest wights, and beauty making beautiful old rhyme, in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, i see their antique pen would have expressed even such a beauty as you master now. so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time, all you prefiguring; and for they looked but with divining eyes, they had not skill enough your worth to sing: for we, which now behold these present days, have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come, can yet the lease of my true love control,  supposed as forfeit to a confined doom. the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured, and the sad augurs mock their own presage; incertainties now crown themselves assured, and peace proclaims olives of endless age. now with the drops of this most balmy time, my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes, since, spite of him, i'll live in this poor rhyme, while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes: and thou in this shalt find thy monument, when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent. what's in the brain that ink may character which hath not figured\r",
      " to thee my true spirit? what's new to speak, what now to register, that may express my love, or thy dear merit? nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine, i must each day say o'er the very same; counting no old thing old, thou mine, i thine,  even as when first i hallowed thy fair name. so that eternal love in love's fresh case, weighs not the dust and injury of age, nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, but makes antiquity for aye his page; finding the first conceit of love there bred, where time and outward form would show it dead. o! never say that i was false of heart, though absence seemed my flame to qualify, as easy might i from my self depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie: that is my home of love: if i have ranged, like him that travels, i return again; just to the time, not with the time exchanged, so that myself bring water for my stain. never believe though in my nature reigned, all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, that it could so preposterously be stained,  to leave for nothing all thy sum of good; for nothing this wide universe i call, save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all. alas! 'tis true, i have gone here and there, and made my self a motley to the view, gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, made old offences of affections new; most true it is, that i have looked on truth askance and strangely; but, by all above, these blenches gave my heart another youth, and worse essays proved thee my best of love. now all is done, have what shall have no end: mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof, to try an older friend, a god in love, to whom i am confined. then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, even to thy pure and most most loving breast. o! for my sake do you with fortune chide, the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds. thence comes it that my name receives a brand, and almost thence my nature is subdued to what it works in, like the dyer's hand: pity me, then, and wish i were renewed; whilst, like a willing patient, i will drink potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection; no bitterness that i will bitter think, nor double penance, to correct correction. pity me then, dear friend, and i assure ye, even that your pity is enough to cure me. your love and pity doth the impression fill, which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow; for what care i who calls me well or ill,  so you o'er-green my bad, my good allow? you are my all-the-world, and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue; none else to me, nor i to none alive, that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong. in so profound abysm i throw all care of others' voices, that my adder's sense to critic and to flatterer stopped are. mark how with my neglect i do dispense: you are so strongly in my purpose bred, that all the world besides methinks y'are dead. since i left you, mine eye is in my mind; and that which governs\r",
      " me to go about doth part his function and is partly blind, seems seeing, but effectually is out; for it no form delivers to the heart of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch: of his quick objects hath the mind no part,  nor his own vision holds what it doth catch; for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight, the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature, the mountain or the sea, the day or night, the crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature. incapable of more, replete with you, my most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue. or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you, drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery? or whether shall i say, mine eye saith true, and that your love taught it this alchemy, to make of monsters and things indigest such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, creating every bad a perfect best, as fast as objects to his beams assemble? o! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, and my great mind most kingly drinks it up: mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,  and to his palate doth prepare the cup: if it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth first begin. those lines that i before have writ do lie, even those that said i could not love you dearer: yet then my judgment knew no reason why my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer. but reckoning time, whose million'd accidents creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings, tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents, divert strong minds to the course of altering things; alas! why, fearing of time's tyranny, might i not then say, 'now i love you best,' when i was certain o'er incertainty, crowning the present, doubting of the rest? love is a babe, then might i not say so, to give full growth to that which still doth grow? let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove: o, no! it is an ever-fixed mark, that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandering bark, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come; love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out even to the edge of doom.   if this be error and upon me proved,   i never writ, nor no man ever loved. accuse me thus: that i have scanted all, wherein i should your great deserts repay, forgot upon your dearest love to call,  whereto all bonds do tie me day by day; that i have frequent been with unknown minds, and given to time your own dear-purchased right; that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight. book both my wilfulness and errors down, and on just proof surmise accumulate; bring me within the level of your frown, but shoot not at me in your wakened hate; since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love. like as, to make our appetites more keen, with eager compounds we our palate urge; as, to prevent our maladies unseen, we sicken to shun sickness when we purge; even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness, to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding; and, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness to be diseased, ere that there was true needing. thus policy in love, to anticipate the ills that were not, grew to faults assured, and brought to medicine a healthful state which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured; but thence i learn and find the lesson true, drugs poison him that so fell sick of you. what potions have i drunk of siren tears, distilled from limbecks foul as hell within, applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears, still losing when i saw myself to win! what wretched errors hath my heart committed, whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never! how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted, in the distraction of this madding fever! o benefit of ill! now i find true that better is by evil still made better; and ruined love, when it is built anew, grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater. so i return rebuked to my content, and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent. that you were once unkind befriends me now, and for that sorrow, which i then did feel, needs must i under my transgression bow, unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel. for if you were by my unkindness shaken, as i by yours, you've passed a hell of time; and i, a tyrant, have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffered in your crime. o! that our night of woe might have remembered my deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits, and soon to you, as you to me, then tendered the humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits! but that your trespass now becomes a fee; mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me. 'tis better to be vile than vile esteemed, when not to be receives reproach of being; and the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed not by our feeling, but by others' seeing: for why should others' false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood? or on my frailties why are frailer spies, which in their wills count bad what i think good? no, i am that i am, and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own: i may be straight though they themselves be bevel; by their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown; unless this general evil they maintain, all men are bad and in their badness reign. thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain full charactered with lasting memory, which shall above that idle rank remain, beyond all date, even to eternity: or, at the least, so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist; till each to razed oblivion yield his part of thee, thy record never can be missed. that poor retention could not so much hold, nor need i tallies thy dear love to score; therefore to give them from me was i bold, to trust those tables that receive thee more: to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me. no, time, thou shalt not boast that i do change: thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel, nothing strange; they are but dressings of a former sight. our dates are brief, and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old; and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told. thy registers and thee i both defy, not wondering at the present nor the past, for thy records and what we see doth lie, made more or less by thy continual haste. this i do vow and this shall ever be; i will be true despite thy scythe and thee. if my dear love were but the child of state, it might for fortune's bastard be unfathered, as subject to time's love or to time's hate, weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered. no, it was builded far from accident; it suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent, whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls: it fears not policy, that heretic, which works on leases of short-number'd hours, but all alone stands hugely politic,  that it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers. to this i witness call the fools of time, which die for goodness, who have lived for crime. were't aught to me i bore the canopy, with my extern the outward honouring, or laid great bases for eternity, which proves more short than waste or ruining? have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet, forgoing simple savour, pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent? no; let me be obsequious in thy heart, and take thou my oblation, poor but free, which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art, but mutual render, only me for thee. hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul when most impeached stands least in thy control. o thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power dost hold time's fickle glass, his sickle,\r",
      " hour; who hast by waning grown, and therein showest thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest. if nature, sovereign mistress over wrack, as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back, she keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill. yet fear her, o thou minion of her pleasure! she may detain, but not still keep, her treasure: her audit (though delayed) answered must be, and her quietus is to render thee. (                                           ) (                                            ) in the old age black was not counted fair, or if it were, it bore not beauty's name; but now is black beauty's successive heir, and beauty slandered with a bastard shame: for since each hand hath put on nature's power,  fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face, sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower, but is profaned, if not lives in disgrace. therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black, her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem at such who, not born fair, no beauty lack, sland'ring creation with a false esteem: yet so they mourn becoming of their woe, that every tongue says beauty should look so. how oft when thou, my music, music play'st, upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st the wiry concord that mine ear confounds, do i envy those jacks that nimble leap, to kiss the tender inward of thy hand, whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap, at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand! to be so tickled, they would change their state  and situation with those dancing chips, o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, making dead wood more bless'd than living lips. since saucy jacks so happy are in this, give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss. the expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action: and till action, lust is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust; enjoyed no sooner but despised straight; past reason hunted; and no sooner had, past reason hated, as a swallowed bait, on purpose laid to make the taker mad. mad in pursuit and in possession so; had, having, and in quest to have extreme; a bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe; before, a joy proposed; behind a dream. all this the world well knows; yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; coral is far more red, than her lips red: if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. i have seen roses damasked, red and white, but no such roses see i in her cheeks; and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. i love to hear her speak, yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound: i grant i never saw a goddess go,  my mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: and yet by heaven, i think my love as rare, as any she belied with false compare. thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,  as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold, thy face hath not the power to make love groan; to say they err i dare not be so bold, although i swear it to myself alone. and to be sure that is not false i swear, a thousand groans, but thinking on thy face, one on another's neck, do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgment's place. in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds, and thence this slander, as i think, proceeds. thine eyes i love, and they, as pitying me, knowing thy heart torments me with disdain, have put on black and loving mourners be, looking with pretty ruth upon my pain. and truly not the morning sun of heaven  better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, nor that full star that ushers in the even, doth half that glory to the sober west, as those two mourning eyes become thy face: o! let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace, and suit thy pity like in every part. then will i swear beauty herself is black, and all they foul that thy complexion lack. beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me! is't not enough to torture me alone, but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be? me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken, and my next self thou harder hast engrossed: of him, myself, and thee i am forsaken; a torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed. prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,  but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail; whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard; thou canst not then use rigour in my jail: and yet thou wilt; for i, being pent in thee, perforce am thine, and all that is in me. so now i have confessed that he is thine, and i my self am mortgaged to thy will, myself i'll forfeit, so that other mine thou wilt restore to be my comfort still: but thou wilt not, nor he will not be free, for thou art covetous, and he is kind; he learned but surety-like to write for me, under that bond that him as fast doth bind. the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use, and sue a friend came debtor for my sake; so him i lose through my unkind abuse. him have i lost; thou hast both him and me: he pays the whole, and yet am i not free. whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will, and will to boot, and will in over-plus; more than enough am i that vexed thee still, to thy sweet will making addition thus. wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious, not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine? shall will in others seem right gracious, and in my will no fair acceptance shine? the sea, all water, yet receives rain still, and in abundance addeth to his store; so thou, being rich in will, add to thy will one will of mine, to make thy large will more. let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill; think all but one, and me in that one will. if thy soul check thee that i come so near,  swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will, and will, thy soul knows, is admitted there; thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil. will, will fulfil the treasure of thy love, ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one. in things of great receipt with ease we prove among a number one is reckoned none: then in the number let me pass untold, though in thy store's account i one must be; for nothing hold me, so it please thee hold that nothing me, a something sweet to thee: make but my name thy love, and love that still, and then thou lovest me for my name is 'will.' thou blind fool, love, what dost thou to mine eyes, that they behold, and see not what they see? they know what beauty is, see where it lies, yet what the best is take the worst to be. if eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,  be anchored in the bay where all men ride, why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks, whereto the judgment of my heart is tied? why should my heart think that a several plot, which my heart knows the wide world's common place? or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not, to put fair truth upon so foul a face? in things right true my heart and eyes have erred, and to this false plague are they now transferred. when my love swears that she is made of truth, i do believe her though i know she lies, that she might think me some untutored youth, unlearned in the world's false subtleties. thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, although she knows my days are past the best, simply i credit her false-speaking tongue: on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed: but wherefore says she not she is unjust?  and wherefore say not i that i am old? o! love's best habit is in seeming trust, and age in love, loves not to have years told: therefore i lie with her, and she with me, and in our faults by lies we flattered be. o! call not me to justify the wrong that thy unkindness lays upon my heart; wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue: use power with power, and slay me not by art, tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight, dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside: what need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide? let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows her pretty looks have been mine enemies; and therefore from my face she turns my foes, that they elsewhere might dart their injuries: yet do not so; but since i am near slain,  kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain. be wise as thou art cruel; do not press my tongue-tied patience with too much disdain; lest sorrow lend me words, and words express the manner of my pity-wanting pain. if i might teach thee wit, better it were, though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;  as testy sick men, when their deaths be near, no news but health from their physicians know;  for, if i should despair, i should grow mad, and in my madness might speak ill of thee; now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad, mad slanderers by mad ears believed be. that i may not be so, nor thou belied, bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide. in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes,  for they in thee a thousand errors note; but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise, who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote. nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted; nor tender feeling, to base touches prone, nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone: but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be: only my plague thus far i count my gain, that she that makes me sin awards me pain. love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate, hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving: o! but with mine compare thou thine own state, and thou shalt find it merits not reproving; or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,  that have profaned their scarlet ornaments and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents. be it lawful i love thee, as thou lov'st those whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee: root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows, thy pity may deserve to pitied be. if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide, by self-example mayst thou be denied! lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch one of her feathered creatures broke away, sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay; whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, cries to catch her whose busy care is bent to follow that which flies before her face, not prizing her poor infant's discontent; so runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,  whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind; but if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me, and play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind; so will i pray that thou mayst have thy 'will,' if thou turn back and my loud crying still. two loves i have of comfort and despair, which like two spirits do suggest me still: the better angel is a man right fair, the worser spirit a woman coloured ill. to win me soon to hell, my female evil, tempteth my better angel from my side, and would corrupt my saint to be a devil, wooing his purity with her foul pride. and whether that my angel be turned fiend, suspect i may, yet not directly tell; but being both from me, both to each friend, i guess one angel in another's hell: yet this shall i ne'er know, but live in doubt,  till my bad angel fire my good one out. those lips that love's own hand did make, breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate', to me that languished for her sake: but when she saw my woeful state, straight in her heart did mercy come, chiding that tongue that ever sweet was used in giving gentle doom; and taught it thus anew to greet; 'i hate' she altered with an end, that followed it as gentle day, doth follow night, who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away. 'i hate', from hate away she threw, and saved my life, saying 'not you'. poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,  ... ... ... these rebel powers that thee array why dost thou pine\r",
      " within and suffer dearth, painting thy outward walls so costly gay? why so large cost, having so short a lease, dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? shall worms, inheritors of this excess, eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end? then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss, and let that pine to aggravate thy store; buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; within be fed, without be rich no more: so shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men, and death once dead, there's no more dying then. my love is as a fever longing still, for that which longer nurseth the disease; feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, the uncertain sickly appetite to please. my reason, the physician to my love,  angry that his prescriptions are not kept, hath left me, and i desperate now approve desire is death, which physic did except. past cure i am, now reason is past care, and frantic-mad with evermore unrest; my thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are, at random from the truth vainly expressed; for i have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright, who art as black as hell, as dark as night. o me! what eyes hath love put in my head, which have no correspondence with true sight; or, if they have, where is my judgment fled, that censures falsely what they see aright? if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, what means the world to say it is not so? if it be not, then love doth well denote love's eye is not so true as all men's: no, how can it? o! how can love's eye be true,  that is so vexed with watching and with tears? no marvel then, though i mistake my view; the sun itself sees not, till heaven clears. o cunning love! with tears thou keep'st me blind, lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find. canst thou, o cruel! say i love thee not, when i against myself with thee partake? do i not think on thee, when i forgot am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake? who hateth thee that i do call my friend, on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon, nay, if thou lour'st on me, do i not spend revenge upon myself with present moan? what merit do i in my self respect, that is so proud thy service to despise, when all my best doth worship thy defect, commanded by the motion of thine eyes? but, love, hate on, for now i know thy mind, those that can see thou lov'st, and i am blind. o! from what power hast thou this powerful might, with insufficiency my heart to sway? to make me give the lie to my true sight, and swear that brightness doth not grace the day? whence hast thou this becoming of things ill, that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill, that, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds? who taught thee how to make me love thee more, the more i hear and see just cause of hate? o! though i love what others do abhor, with others thou shouldst not abhor my state: if thy unworthiness raised love in me, more worthy i to be beloved of thee. love is too young to know what conscience is,  yet who knows not conscience is born of love? then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss, lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove: for, thou betraying me, i do betray my nobler part to my gross body's treason; my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason, but rising at thy name doth point out thee, as his triumphant prize. proud of this pride, he is contented thy poor drudge to be, to stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side. no want of conscience hold it that i call her love, for whose dear love i rise and fall. in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn, but thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing; in act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn, in vowing new hate after new love bearing: but why of two oaths' breach do i accuse thee,  when i break twenty? i am perjured most; for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee, and all my honest faith in thee is lost: for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness, oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy; and, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness, or made them swear against the thing they see; for i have sworn thee fair; more perjured eye, to swear against the truth so foul a lie! cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep: a maid of dian's this advantage found, and his love-kindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valley-fountain of that ground; which borrowed from this holy fire of love, a dateless lively heat, still to endure, and grew a seething bath, which yet men prove against strange maladies a sovereign cure. but at my mistress' eye love's brand new-fired,  the boy for trial needs would touch my breast; i, sick withal, the help of bath desired, and thither hied, a sad distempered guest, but found no cure, the bath for my help lies where cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes. the little love-god lying once asleep, laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand, whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep came tripping by; but in her maiden hand the fairest votary took up that fire which many legions of true hearts had warmed; and so the general of hot desire was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed. this brand she quenched in a cool well by, which from love's fire took heat perpetual, growing a bath and healthful remedy, for men diseased; but i, my mistress' thrall, came there for cure and this by that i prove,  love's fire heats water, water cools not love.     \n"
